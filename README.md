# GetAndCleanData_CourseProject

First: A script titled run_analysis.r  was created to do the following:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each

A full explanation of the steps can be found in the CodeBook_run_analysis file. 

The final output from step 5 can be found in FinalData.txt
